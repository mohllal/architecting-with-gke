# Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine Specialization

This directory contains my notes and highlights for the [Coursera's Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/architecting-google-kubernetes-engine) specialization offered by [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

In this specialization, Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine, I learned how to implement solutions using Google Kubernetes Engine, or GKE, including building, scheduling, load balancing, and monitoring workloads, as well as providing for discovery of services, managing role-based access control and security, and providing persistent storage to these applications.
