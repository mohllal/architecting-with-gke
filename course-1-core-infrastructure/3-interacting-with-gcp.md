# Module 3: Interacting with Google Cloud Platform

- There are four ways we can use to interact with Google Cloud Platform:
  - The *Console*.
  - The *SDK* and *Cloud Shell*.
  - The *Mobile App*.
  - The *APIs*.
- Google provides *client libraries* that take a lot of the drudgery out of the task of calling GCP directly from the code. There are two kinds of libraries:
  - The ***Cloud Client Libraries*** are Google cloud latest and recommended libraries for its APIs. They adopt the native styles and idioms of each language.
  - On the other hand, sometimes a *Cloud Client Library doesn't support the newest services* and features. In that case, we can use the ***Google API Client Library*** for our desired languages. These libraries are designed for generality and completeness.
- Some Cloud Marketplace images charge users fees, particularly those published by third parties with commercially licensed software. No additional charge beyond the normal usage fees for GCP resources goes to Google.
